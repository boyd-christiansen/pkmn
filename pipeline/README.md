# pipeline

Atomic Python modules that turn raw Pokémon Showdown replays into SFT-ready
conversational training data. **All six modules are implemented**:
`replay_parser.py`, `canonical_priors.py`, `damage_inferencer.py`,
`threat_matrix.py`, `teacher_llm.py`, and `master_pipeline.py`.

## Setup

```bash
cd pipeline
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
```

Deps: `aiohttp`, `tqdm`, `click`. Python ≥3.11.

## Architecture principle

Every module here is **atomic and isolation-respecting**. Each one:

- has a single, narrow responsibility,
- declares its inputs and outputs in its docstring,
- talks to at most one external system (e.g. only the calc service, or only
  the teacher LLM, or no network at all),
- can be swapped without touching the others.

The orchestrator (`master_pipeline.py`) is the **only** file allowed to import
from all the others. The reverse is forbidden — sibling modules never import
each other and never import the orchestrator.

This rule is what lets us swap out e.g. the teacher LLM (GPT-4o → Claude →
o-series) or the calc engine without rewriting the whole pipeline.

## Modules

### `replay_parser.py` *(implemented)*

ETL: walks the scraper output, stitches Bo3 series, posts each `log` to
[`calc_microservice`](../calc_microservice/)'s `POST /parse_log` endpoint, and
emits one JSONL row per *match*.

- **In:** raw replay JSONs at `../data_scraper/data/replays/{format_id}/*.json`,
  plus a running calc microservice (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`).
- **Out:** `parsed_data/bo1.jsonl`, `parsed_data/bo3.jsonl`,
  `parsed_data/failures.jsonl` — one match per line.
- **Touches:** the `/parse_log` endpoint only. No regex parsing of logs (the
  `@pkmn/client` Battle state machine on the Node side handles edge cases like
  Zoroark illusion, end-of-turn order, multi-hit moves, forme changes, etc).
- **Stitching rules (Bo3):** group games by sorted player pair → sort by
  `uploadtime` → split a new series whenever consecutive games are >30 min apart
  *or* the current series already has 3 games (the Bo3 ceiling — back-to-back
  matches between the same players otherwise get glued together).
- **Resumable:** existing JSONL is scanned at startup; matches already present
  are skipped. Failed matches go to `failures.jsonl` and are retried on rerun.

#### CLI

```bash
.venv/bin/python replay_parser.py                              # full run, both formats
.venv/bin/python replay_parser.py --limit 10 --format bo3      # 10-match smoke test
.venv/bin/python replay_parser.py --concurrency 16             # more parallelism
.venv/bin/python replay_parser.py --bo3-gap-minutes 45         # tune stitching gap
```

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--scraper-dir` | `../data_scraper/data/replays` | Root of scraper output. |
| `--output-dir` | `parsed_data/` | Where JSONL + failures go. |
| `--parse-url` | `http://localhost:3000/parse_log` | Mechanics service endpoint. |
| `--concurrency` | `8` | Max in-flight `/parse_log` requests. |
| `--bo3-gap-minutes` | `30` | Series-split threshold. |
| `--limit` | none | Process only the first N matches (test batch). |
| `--format` | both | `bo1` or `bo3` to restrict. |

#### Output row shape

```json
{
  "match_id": "bo3-gen9vgc2026regibo3-2563049793",
  "players":  ["carrotvg", "Yippeewoohoo"],
  "format":   "bo3",
  "games": [
    { "replay_id": "...", "timestamp": 1773978060, "snapshots": [...] },
    { "replay_id": "...", "timestamp": 1773978161, "snapshots": [...] }
  ]
}
```

`snapshots` is the array returned verbatim by `/parse_log` — see the
[calc_microservice README](../calc_microservice/README.md#post-parse_log) for
the per-turn shape.

### `canonical_priors.py` *(implemented — Smogon-backed)*

Returns the *probable* spread (EVs / IVs / nature) for a species under
standard meta play. Backs the **Probable Range** track in
`threat_matrix.py`.

- **API:** `get_probable_spread(species, format_id=None) -> ProbableSpread`.
  The result has a `source` field: `"chaos"` | `"curated"` | `"heuristic"`.
- **Lookup order** (each step falls through on miss):
  1. **Smogon Chaos JSON** at `pipeline/data/smogon_chaos_{format_id}.json` —
     loads the per-species `Spreads` dict and picks the most-used
     `"Nature:hp/atk/def/spa/spd/spe"` entry. Real usage data.
  2. **Curated table** of spreads for the top ~40 Reg I species (Calyrex-Shadow
     → Timid SpA/Spe, Amoonguss → Calm HP/SpD, etc.). Used when chaos
     hasn't been bootstrapped or the species genuinely has 0 usage rows.
  3. **Base-stat heuristic** for anything else (offensive vs bulky vs default).
- **Touches:** at runtime, only the local cache file. Network access is
  isolated to `fetch_chaos(...)` (CLI-invoked).

#### Bootstrap

```bash
cd pipeline
.venv/bin/python canonical_priors.py --format-id gen9vgc2026regi
.venv/bin/python canonical_priors.py --format-id gen9vgc2026regibo3
```

Walks back from the current month until a 200 OK chaos file is found
(default: 12 months back), saves to `pipeline/data/smogon_chaos_<format_id>.json`.
Add `--cutoff 1500` to use the high-ladder cut instead of all rated games.

### `damage_inferencer.py` *(implemented — dual-state, two-way)*

Maintains a `KnowledgeState` per side (the orchestrator holds two:
`p1_knowledge`, `p2_knowledge`) — per-species `min_evs` / `max_evs` boxes
in `[0, 252]^6`. Each observed damage event tightens **both** sides at once
via binary search against the calc microservice.

- **In:** turn snapshots, a `list[DamageEvent]` for the turn (slot-based:
  `attacker_slot="p1a"`, `defender_slot="p2b"`, `move_name`,
  `hp_before_pct`, `hp_after_pct`, `is_crit`, `is_ko`), and both
  `KnowledgeState`s.
- **Out:** the same `(p1_knowledge, p2_knowledge)` tuple, mutated in
  place — `min_evs` ratcheted up, `max_evs` ratcheted down per event.
- **Touches:** `POST /calc` and `GET /dex/move/:name`. No replay parsing,
  no LLM, no sibling imports.
- **Two-way binary search.** For each non-status event we run six binary
  searches per damage event:
  - DEFENDER `min_def`, `max_def`, `min_hp`, `max_hp`
  - ATTACKER `min_off`, `max_off` (`atk` if physical, `spa` if special)

  Cross-side coupling is handled with interval arithmetic — when
  searching the defender, the attacker is held at its *least restrictive*
  current bound, and vice versa. Symmetric for HP.
- **Atomic application.** All six searches use **pre-update** bounds, then
  results apply at the end. Order-independent.
- **Crits supported.** `event.is_crit=True` is forwarded to `/calc` via the
  `move: { name, isCrit: true }` payload form. The calc applies the 1.5×
  multiplier and bypasses the defender's positive boosts, so the inference
  remains valid for crit observations.
- **Multi-hit filter.** Triple Axel / Bullet Seed / Population Bomb / etc.
  emit one `DamageEvent` per hit. The inferencer counts same
  `(attacker_slot, move_name, defender_slot)` tuples per turn and **skips
  all of them** if the count > 1 — supporting them properly would need
  `/calc` to accept a `hits` field and the events to be aggregated upstream.
- **508-EV total constraint.** After the six binary searches, a cheap pass
  enforces the 508-EV usable budget per Pokémon: `max_evs[s] ≤ 508 −
  (sum_of_other_min_evs)`. Once one or two stats are known to be heavily
  invested (e.g. Atk≥252 + Spe≥252 = 504), the other four collapse to ≤4
  in a single pass — solves the HP/Def coupling that binary search alone
  converges on slowly.
- **Fuzzy HP:** ±0.9% tolerance to absorb the 1% rounding on
  spectator-visible HP bars.
- **Skip rules:** Status-category moves, missing slots, multi-hit
  occurrences, and observations with no consistent EV in `[0, 252]` (data
  inconsistency — bounds left untouched).
- **Source of `action_log`:** `/parse_log` now emits per-turn `actionLog`
  arrays inline with each snapshot. The orchestrator pairs
  `snapshot[N].actionLog` with `snapshot_pre = snapshot[N]`,
  `snapshot_post = snapshot[N+1]`.

### Format split: CTS (Bo1) vs OTS (Bo3)

The pipeline branches on `match_record["format"]`:

- **Bo1 / CTS** (`gen9vgc2026regi`): no `|showteam|` lines in the log.
  `replay_parser.py`'s `games[].teamSheets` is `null`. `master_pipeline`
  uses `reconstruct_p1_team` (forward-scan + `[UNREVEALED_MOVE]` padding)
  and `teacher_llm.render_system_prompt` (Bo1 template + Masking Rule).
  Behavior **unchanged** from before this feature.
- **Bo3 / OTS** (`gen9vgc2026regibo3`): `|showteam|` decoded by
  `@pkmn/sets`'s `Teams.unpackTeam` on the Node side. `games[].teamSheets`
  is `{ p1: OtsPokemonSet[6], p2: OtsPokemonSet[6] }`. `master_pipeline`
  uses `teacher_llm.render_system_prompt_bo3` (full sheets for both
  sides, ★ markers on P1's brought 4, no Masking Rule). KnowledgeStates
  are seeded with all 6 species per side. Active Pokémon snapshots get
  OTS-known `item` / `ability` / `teraType` from turn 1, and a new
  `knownMoves: string[4] | null` field carries the OTS-known full moveset
  — `threat_matrix` prefers `knownMoves` when present (Bo3) and falls
  back to `revealedMoves` (Bo1). VGC OTS does not reveal EVs / IVs /
  Nature, so the dual-track inferencer continues to do the heavy lifting
  on spread bounds.

### `threat_matrix.py` *(implemented — dual-track)*

Renders the per-turn damage envelope as a compact human-readable text
block, with **two damage tracks per matchup**:

- **Absolute** — strict mathematical envelope from the live
  `KnowledgeState`s. Wide but provable.
- **Probable (meta)** — single calc result using each Pokémon's
  `canonical_priors` spread. Narrow, fast, and only as good as the prior.

When the canonical prior is clipped from the inferred KnowledgeState
bounds by **≥ 40 EVs** on any relevant stat, the Probable calc is
**skipped entirely** for that line and only the Absolute envelope is
shown, tagged `(off-meta)`. Avoids surfacing a "meta" range we've
already disproven.

- **In:** one snapshot, `p1_side` (which side is "us"), **both**
  `p1_knowledge` and `p2_knowledge`, and an optional `format_id` (forwarded
  to `canonical_priors` so the Probable track uses real Smogon usage data
  when a chaos cache is bootstrapped for that format).
- **Out:** a single string, grouped per attacker. Each attacker block
  shows one line per (move, defender) pair (or a single grouped line
  per spread move). Off-meta lines drop the Probable column. Chip moves
  (max % < 15% across every defender) are collapsed into a single
  footer line per attacker.
- **Touches:** `POST /calc` (2 calls per (move, defender) cell when
  off-meta — abs-low, abs-high; +1 Probable call when in-meta) and
  `GET /dex/move/:name` (cached, fetched for category + target).
  Status moves filtered out.
- **Volatile state:** status, boosts, weather, terrain, side conditions,
  Tera state — all threaded into every payload from the snapshot.
- **Spread modifier auto-applies.** Doubles spread moves
  (`allAdjacentFoes`, `foeSide`, `allAdjacent`) get the 0.75× modifier
  for free from `@smogon/calc` when `field.gameType: "Doubles"`. Output
  presentation groups them into one `[spread]` line listing every
  defender.

#### Output line format

```
[us Chi-Yu]  (boosts={spe: -1, spa: -2})
  Heat Wave [spread]: Miraidon 11.7%–13.7%, Iron Bundle 47.8%–62.6%  [Iron Bundle: guaranteed 2HKO]  (off-meta)
  Overheat → Iron Bundle    85.5%–116.8%  | meta 103.0%–122.7%  [guaranteed OHKO]
  …plus 1 chip move(s): Snarl
```

### `teacher_llm.py` *(implemented)*

Drives a frontier OpenAI model through a tool-calling loop, eliciting a
chain-of-thought that JUSTIFIES a known human play. Returns OpenAI-fine-
tuning-ready conversation messages.

- **API:** `await synthesize_turn(system_prompt, user_prompt, human_action,
  *, tools_allowed=True, ...)` → `list[dict] | None`.
- **Tools exposed to the LLM:** `calculate_damage` — JSON schema mirrors
  `/calc`'s payload (Pokémon × move × field, with `isCrit` / `evs` / `nature`
  / etc. all optional).
- **Final-output schema:** strict JSON schema enforced via OpenAI's
  `response_format: json_schema`. Shape: `{ pre_tool_thought: string,
  action: { slot_1, slot_2 } }`. Each slot has
  `{action_type: "move"|"switch"|"pass", move?, target?, tera?, switch_to?}`.
- **Ground-truth handling:** during the API call, the user message has the
  human's play appended as an `=== EXPERT'S DECISION ===` suffix. The
  returned messages have that suffix **stripped** — saved SFT examples
  show only board state + threat matrix.
- **Tool loop:** up to 6 iterations (`MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS`). Each iteration:
  call OpenAI, append assistant message, execute any `calculate_damage`
  tool calls via `aiohttp` to `/calc`, append tool messages, loop. Returns
  on a no-tool-call response (final answer) or `None` on iteration cap.
- **Critical Rules in the system prompt** include the **Masking Rule**
  verbatim from the project spec: `[UNREVEALED_MOVE]` slots are presumed
  suboptimal and not to be reasoned about.
- **Touches:** OpenAI Chat Completions API + `/calc` (tool execution).
  No replay parsing, no inference, no canonical-priors imports.

### `master_pipeline.py` *(implemented)*

Orchestrator. Walks `parsed_data/{bo1,bo3}.jsonl`, generates one SFT example
per identifiable turn, writes to `parsed_data/sft_training_data.jsonl`.

**Series-winner-as-P1.** Every saved SFT example is generated from the
perspective of the player who won the series (Bo3: 2 of 3 games; Bo1:
the per-game winner). `flip_match_to_winner` rewrites the entire match
record — `players[0] ↔ players[1]`, every snapshot's `p1 ↔ p2` and
`tailwindP1 ↔ tailwindP2`, every `actionLog` event's slot identifiers
(`p1a ↔ p2a`, `p1b ↔ p2b`), and per-game `teamSheets.p1 ↔ teamSheets.p2`
— so all downstream code (action extraction, threat matrix, system
prompt rendering) reads "p1" as the winner from this point on.

Why winner-only: the model is trained to play *correctly*, not to mimic
losing patterns at the same Elo. Including some intra-series losses
(games the series-winner lost) preserves variance — in a Bo3 the
series-winner sometimes drops a game to RNG / matchup, and that
reasoning is still high-quality.

**Inferred P1 spreads in the user prompt.** Each turn's user prompt
includes a `=== YOUR SPREADS (inferred) ===` block listing per-stat EV
ranges for each active P1 mon, derived from the running
`p1_knowledge`. Stats whose bound width exceeds 60 EVs collapse to
`?` so wide-open turn-1 bounds don't flood the prompt. The Spread Rule
in the system prompt tells the model how to reason from ranges (worst
case for survival checks, best case for offensive checks) and
acknowledges that exact values may also be presented at deploy time.

- **`reconstruct_p1_team(games)`** — forward-scan over every snapshot in
  the match (across all Bo3 games), aggregating revealed `item`, `ability`,
  `teraType`, `isTerastallized`, and `revealedMoves` per P1 species. Pads
  each Pokémon's move list to exactly 4 with `"[UNREVEALED_MOVE]"`.
- **`extract_p1_actions(snap_pre, snap_post, action_log)`** —
  reverse-engineers each P1 active slot's action:
  - Damage move → look in `action_log` (`attacker_slot == "p1a"|"p1b"`).
    Multiple `defender_slot`s on one attacker = `"spread"` target.
  - Tera detected by `isTerastallized` going false→true between snapshots.
  - Switch detected by species change at the same slot.
  - Status move detected by exactly-1 new entry in `revealedMoves` between
    snapshots when neither damage event nor switch was observed.
  - Returns `None` if any slot is ambiguous → caller skips the turn.
- **Process loop** per match:
  1. `reconstruct_p1_team` + gather P2 species from snapshots.
  2. `init_knowledge` for both sides at fully-open `[0, 252]` bounds (per
     project spec: canonical priors live in the threat-matrix Probable
     track only; the inferencer's Absolute track stays strict-math).
  3. Render system prompt (with team block + Masking Rule).
  4. For each `(snap_pre, snap_post, snap_pre.actionLog)` triple in turn
     order:
     - Extract P1's action; skip turn if ambiguous.
     - Generate threat matrix (uses `format_id` for chaos-backed Probable).
     - Format user prompt (snapshot + threat matrix).
     - `await teacher_llm.synthesize_turn(...)`.
     - Append the resulting messages as one row to the SFT JSONL.
     - `await damage_inferencer.update_knowledge(...)` to tighten both
       KnowledgeStates for the next iteration.
- **Resumable:** `(match_id, game_index, turn)` keys already present in the
  output JSONL are skipped on rerun.
- **`--dry-run`:** exercises the entire orchestration except the OpenAI
  call; emits a placeholder assistant message containing the actual human
  action. Useful for verifying the pipeline without spending API credits.

### Orchestrator data flow

```
raw replay JSON
    → replay_parser  →  per-turn snapshots (with actionLog)
    │
    │  per match: K1, K2 = init_knowledge(p1_team), init_knowledge(p2_team)
    │             (full open bounds — canonical priors live in Probable track only)
    │
    │  for each turn in order:
    │    → master_pipeline.extract_p1_actions(snap_pre, snap_post, action_log)
    │      (the human's ground-truth play; skip turn if ambiguous)
    │    → threat_matrix.generate(snap_pre, "p1", K1, K2, format_id=…)
    │      (dual-track Absolute + Probable, [PRIOR CONTRADICTED] flagged)
    │    → teacher_llm.synthesize_turn(system, user, human_action)
    │      (tool-call loop, returns OpenAI fine-tuning messages)
    │    → write JSONL row
    │    → damage_inferencer.update_knowledge(snap_pre, snap_post, events, K1, K2)
    │      (tightens both KnowledgeStates atomically + 508-EV constraint)
```

## Status

| Module | State |
|---|---|
| `replay_parser.py` | Working. Run `python replay_parser.py --help`. Captures per-turn `actionLog` from `/parse_log` into the JSONL. |
| `canonical_priors.py` | Working. Library + bootstrap CLI. Reads Smogon Chaos JSON when present; falls back to curated table → heuristic. |
| `damage_inferencer.py` | Working. Dual-state, two-way binary search, atomic apply, 508-EV constraint pass, crit-aware via `/calc isCrit`, multi-hit filter. |
| `threat_matrix.py` | Working. Dual-track Absolute + Probable output with `[PRIOR CONTRADICTED]` flag. Optional `format_id` drives Smogon-backed priors. |
| `teacher_llm.py` | Working. OpenAI tool-use loop; concise rules (Masking/OTS, Tool, Threat-Matrix, Spread, Alternatives, Output); ground-truth stripping; `# TODO(rlhf-followup)` for proper minimax distillation of alternatives. |
| `master_pipeline.py` | Working. `flip_match_to_winner` makes every SFT example come from the series winner's perspective; inferred-spread block in user prompt; per-format system prompt branch. `--dry-run` exercises orchestration without OpenAI cost. |

## Planned follow-up workstreams (TODO)

- **Selection-model SFT corpus** — separate dataset for the team-preview
  4-of-6 pick decision. Walks the same parsed replays, extracts P1's
  brought set per game, generates one selection example per game with
  `{p1_full_6, p2_full_6, format_meta} → {brought: [4 species]}`. Trains
  as its own model (no tactical play, no tool calls); deployed before
  the turn-play model takes over. Lives in a sibling module, not in
  `master_pipeline.py`.
- **Minimax / MCTS distillation for the tool-use loop** — replaces the
  current prompt-driven alternative evaluation (Alternatives Rule in
  the system prompt) with a proper search step that surfaces
  genuinely-competitive alternative plays for the teacher to articulate
  rejection of. The current approach has the teacher cherry-picking
  weak alternatives because it knows the answer. See the
  `# TODO(rlhf-followup)` in `teacher_llm.py`.
